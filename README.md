# Properties-of-Compact-Groups-of-Galaxies

This Python script performs data analysis and visualization tasks on astronomical datasets using various statistical and visualization libraries. The script reads data from different tab-separated value files, conducts statistical tests, calculates correlations, and generates visualizations to provide insights into the data.

The script's main tasks include:
1. Loading astronomical data from CSV files using the Pandas library.
2. Conducting statistical tests like Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to assess data normality and distribution similarity.
3. Using the Astropy library to perform cosmological calculations on astronomical data.
4. Creating histograms and scatter plots to visualize data distribution and relationships.
5. Calculating correlations between different data columns using Pearson correlation coefficient.
6. Utilizing Matplotlib to generate visualizations for better understanding of the data.
